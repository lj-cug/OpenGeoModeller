LULESH ADIOS Catalyst
=====================

This is the code to validate the the [ADIOS-Catalyst](https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/adioscatalyst) implementation with the [LULESH](https://asc.llnl.gov/codes/proxy-apps/lulesh) code.

The original Catalyst 2.0 implementation could be found at the [ISC 22 tutorial about "In Situ Analysis and Visualization with ParaView Catalyst and Ascent"](https://github.com/jfavre/InSitu-Vis-Tutorial2022/tree/main/Examples/LULESH) from Jean Favre and Fran√ßois Mazen.

All the specific codes to launch in-transit analysis and compare with in-situ analysis are under the `adios` folder.
