Simple Screen Recorder is a fantastic piece of software that was initially developed by its author to record output of programs and games. In time it became everything but ¡®simple¡¯, keeping its name not because of a lack in functionality but due to its easy-to-use interface.

Follow these steps to install Simple Screen Recorder:

```
add-apt-repository ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder
apt-get update
apt-get install simplescreenrecorder
```
