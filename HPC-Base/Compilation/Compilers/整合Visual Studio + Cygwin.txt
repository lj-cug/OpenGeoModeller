If you want a more fully integrated solution, you're going to need to do two things. 

整合Visual Studio 和 Cygwin开发环境，只需要两步设置：

第一步：
First of all, you're going to need to change out all of your include/library paths to avoid 
the Microsoft ones and go after the Cygwin ones instead. 
You can do this by selecting "Tools->Options" from the menu, 
then choosing "Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories" from the tree on the left hand side of 
the window that comes up. You'll have options to change the search directories for executables, 
headers, libraries, etc. 
For what you're trying to do, I'd suggest removing everything and adding in just 
the cygwin directories.

第二步：
Second, you'll have to tell Visual Studio to use the gcc/g++ compiler. 
This is a bit trickier. VS supports custom build rules for custom file types... 
but it seems to have C++ hardwired in for the Microsoft compiler. 
I don't really know a great way around that except to use your own custom file extension. 
You can try the standard unix extensions of .c (C files) and .cc (C++ files), 
but I suspect Visual Studio will automatically pick up on those. 
You may have to go with something totally foreign.

If you right click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Custom Build Rules" 
you'll be given an interface that will let you create your custom build rules for the file extension 
you've chosen. The interface is relatively straightforward from there.
