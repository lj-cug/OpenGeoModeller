# Makefile Templates

## Language

[English](./Readme.md) | [简体中文](./Readme-cn.md)

## Introduction

Here are some **Makefile Templates** for different size of projects, from simple project with a 'flat' source file structure, to bigger project with a 'complex' structure.

These templates may not be clear or concise enough, but they are built for specific scenes. Some of them may have severe side-effect when the project grows, but that shoud be the time to consider changing a better Makefile from other templates we provided.

Feel free to raise issues, or contribute pull-requests, we welcome all kinds of ideas.
