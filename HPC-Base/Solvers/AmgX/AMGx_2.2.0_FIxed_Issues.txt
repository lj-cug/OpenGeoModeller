AMGX v2.1.0

Changelog:

Added new API that allows user to provide distributed matrix partitioning information in a new way - offset to the partition's first row in a matrix. Works only if partitions own continuous rows in matrix. Added example case for this new API (see examples/amgx_mpi_capi_cla.c)
Distributed code improvements
Tested configurations:

gcc 7.5, gcc 6.4
CUDA 9.0, CUDA 10.0
OpenMPI 4.0
NVIDIA V100
Note that while AMGX has support for building in Windows, it is not actively tested and may malfunction or has issues building the library.
