### Tip

The starting point for administering a Lustre file system is to monitor all logs and console logs for system health:

\- Monitor logs on all servers and all clients.

\- Invest in tools that allow you to condense logs from multiple systems.

\- Use the logging resources provided in the Linux distribution.
