AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler

AOCC Compiler suite

The AOCC compiler system is a high performance, production quality code generation tool. The AOCC environment provides various options to developers when building and optimizing C, C++, and Fortran applications targeting 32-bit and 64-bit Linux? platforms. The AOCC compiler system offers a high level of advanced optimizations, multi-threading and processor support that includes global optimization, vectorization, inter-procedural analyses, loop transformations, and code generation. AMD also provides highly optimized libraries, which extract the optimal performance from each x86 processor core when utilized. The AOCC Compiler Suite simplifies and accelerates development and tuning for x86 applications.


AOCC v2.1:

Tuned for AMD Family 17h processors	Based on LLVM 9.0 release (llvm.org, 19th Sep 2019) with bug fixes
Machine dependent optimizations for better performance in AMD EPYC 7xx2-series architectures	Optimized libraries including AMDLibM (libM math library v3.3)
Enhanced high-level optimizations towards AMD EPYC 7xx2-series of architectures	LLVM linker (lld) as the default linker
Improved Flang ¨C as default Fortran front-end with added F2008 features	Tested on RHEL 7.4, SLES 12 sp3, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 19.04
 

Note: AOCC compiler binaries are suitable for Linux systems having glibC version 2.17 and above only.
