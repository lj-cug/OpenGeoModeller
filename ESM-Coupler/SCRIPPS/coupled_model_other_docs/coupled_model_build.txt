How to build the coupled model for the Arabian Sea?

Download everything here (it would take some time):
wget ftp://sioftp.ucsd.edu/CW3E_DataShare/RSun_SKRIPS/generate_arabian_sea_wave.zip
or
wget -r -nH --cut-dirs=2 ftp://sioftp.ucsd.edu/CW3E_DataShare/RSun_SKRIPS/generate_arabian_sea_wave/

First, we use WW3 gridgen tool to generate the bathymetry and wave model. We can get the gridgen tool from here (the official GitHub link does not have supporting documentation):

ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/ww3/COURS/WAVES_SHORT_COURSE/TUTORIALS/TUTORIAL_GRIDGEN/waves-workshop-exercise-gridgen.pdf
https://croco-ocean.gitlabpages.inria.fr/croco_doc/tutos/tutos.16.coupling.prepro.ww3.html

Then you can use gridgen to generate the grid for WW3. The bathymetry of the WW3 grid will also be used as the bathymetry in MITgcm. I have attached the scripts to use gridgen. Please go through the gridgen tutorial before using this code:

test_ww3_grid/test_075.m

After running test_075.m, we get (1) AS-075.* files for WW3 grid, and (2) depth_mitgcm.mat for MITgcm bathymetry.

Pay attention to the inputs in test_075.m when running on another machine.

To set up the WW3 model, we should (1) run the global WW3 model and output the boundary condition for the regional model; (2) run a spin-up model for the regional domain using the boundary condition from the global model; (3) perform the production run using restart file from step (2) and the boundary conditions from (1). This is not necessary for the coupled model without using waves.

Next, we prepare the MITgcm model. We do everything in mitgcm-preprocess folder.

First we use the Matlab code to generate the bathymetry (copy the bathymetry file depth_mitgcm.mat to this folder before running it):
gen_mesh_no_mask/genMesh.m

Then, get the HYCOM initial and boundary conditions. Make necessary changes if you want to download the HYCOM data at a different time. I am using the HYCOM GOFS 3.1 data (more about the HYCOM data is here: https://www.hycom.org/dataserver/gofs-3pt1/analysis): 
get_hycom/get_all.m
get_hycom/get_east.m
get_hycom/get_south.m

There might be missing data in HYCOM. I usually do an average of two neighbouring datasets to get the missing data.

Use obcs=‘east’ and ‘south’ to generate the HYCOM boundary conditions (run the code twice):
get_hycom/gen_obcs_noncorrect.m

After we get the bathymetry, we need to run an empty model to get the grid information to generate the MITgcm initial and boundary conditions:
cd set-mask/
./install.sh
cd run/
./Allrun

cd ../../save_ic_obcs/
./copyMesh.sh
cd ..
 
Finally, interpolate everything to get the initial and boundary conditions for MITgcm. When running the code, please check the Matlab scripts have consistent setups as the grid information and the code in get_hycom folder:
gen_ic_obcs/gen_ic_hycom.m
gen_ic_obcs/gen_obcs_hycom.m

After we run the code successfully, the MITgcm initial and boundary conditions are saved in: 
save_ic_obcs

Next, prepare the WRF model as mentioned in the other documentation.

—————————

Finally we get the *.bin files from MITgcm and the *.nc files from WRF. Now we can prepare the coupled model based on L3C1 and L3C2 cases.
