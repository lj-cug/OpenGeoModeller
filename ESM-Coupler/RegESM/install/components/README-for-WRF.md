# WRF

Implementation of the new atmospheric model component is still under development and there is a plan to release it around September, 2017. The new atmospheric model component will replace the existing one (RegCM) to solve the stability issues of coupled modeling system due to the problem in the implementation of the RegCM non-hydrostatic core, which is inherited from outdated MM5 code. We are expecting to have more stable modeling system expecially for very high resolution (< 3 km) applications along with WRF online nesting capablity.
