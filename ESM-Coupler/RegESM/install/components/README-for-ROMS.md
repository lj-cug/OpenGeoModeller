# Regional Ocean Model (ROMS)

To install ROMS with coupling support, the user need to patch the original version of the model. The patch includes set of minor modifications to prepare ROMS ocean model for the coupling. The reader also notes that there is no any generic patch for the all versions ROMS due to the existence of the different versions and branches (i.e. [Rutgers University¡¯s ROMS](https://www.myroms.org), [CROCCO (or AGRIF ROMS)](https://www.croco-ocean.org), [UCLA ROMS](http://research.atmos.ucla.edu/cesr/ROMS_page.html), [ROMS with sea-ice](https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms)) of the model. On the other hand, we are colaborating with Rutgers University to implement out-of-box support for ROMS model. There is a plan to have initial version of the Rutgers University¡¯s ROMS soon.

The current version of the RegESM comes with patches that are created by using a snapshot of the [ROMS external branch with sea-ice support](https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms) and [Rutgers University¡¯s ROMS (revision 809)](https://www.myroms.org). The user also note that the sea-ice branch has cpability of coupled with CICE model but this version is not tested with RegESM modeling system yet. All patches can be found under [here](https://github.com/uturuncoglu/RegESM/tree/master/tools/ocn). Applying the selected patch is simple and the given version of the patch can be used as a reference to modify the any possible future ROMS versions and revisions.

To get specific revision and to apply patch:

```
svn checkout -r 809 --username [USER NAME] https://www.myroms.org/svn/src/trunk roms-r809
cd roms-r809
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uturuncoglu/RegESM/master/tools/ocn/roms-r809.patch
patch -p 3 < roms-r809.patch
```

**Do not forget to replace [USER NAME] in the commands***

To activate coupling in ROMS, user could add following CPP flags in the header file (*.h) created for specific application.

| CPP Flag | Description |
|:---:| :---:|
| REGCM_COUPLING | Activates coupling with atmospheric model component |
| MODIFIED_CALDATE | Fix bug in ROMS caldate subroutine |
| HD_COUPLING | Activates coupling with river routing model component |
| PERFECT_RESTART | It requires to restart the coupled modeling system (do not forgot to set the LcycleRST == F and NRST for daily restart output)|

Also note that **ATM_PRESS** and **SHORTWAVE** CPP options are suggested for realistic applications.

For installation of ROMS model and create a realistic application, please refer to ROMS [documentation](https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Documentation_Portal).
