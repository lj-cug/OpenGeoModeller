OASIS3-MCT_4.0 official release

We are pleased to let you know that a new official version of the OASIS coupler, OASIS3-MCT_4.0, is now ready!
This new version specifically includes, in particular:
A hybrid MPI+OpenMP parallelisation of the SCRIP library (previously fully sequential) leading to great reduction in the offline calculation time of the remapping weights; 
A new communication method, using the remapping weights to define the intermediate mapping decomposition, offering a significant gain at run time;
New methods introduced in the global CONSERV operation reducing its costs by one order of magnitude while still ensuring an appropriate level of reproducibility;
Support for bundle coupling fields;
Automatic coupling restart writing ;
бн and other minor functionalities for you to discover (see section B.1 of the User Guide for more details).
