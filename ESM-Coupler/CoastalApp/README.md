# CoastalApp

美国研发的近海岸模拟系统, 采用ESMF耦合了众多模式, 可读取HWRF输出数据, 定量模拟风暴潮过程

***CoastalApp*** is a modeling framework for coastal applications and regional forecasts. It consists of coupled modeling components that link the atmospheric, ocean and terrestrial realms under one common framework. CoastalApp is a flexible and portable modeling system. Flexibility means that additional modeling components can be added with ease and portability means that CoastalApp can be built and run under different computing environments and operating systems.
