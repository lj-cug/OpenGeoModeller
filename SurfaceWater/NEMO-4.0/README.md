# NEMO-4.0-PDAF的研发

vyou receive this mail, because you registered for downloading PDAF, the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework, at http://pdaf.awi.de.

We like to announce that the PDAF code is now also available on github.com at:
https://github.com/PDAF/PDAF

this repository is focused on the PDAF release versions and potential bug fixes. 

In addition you can find PDAF releases, which are citable with a DOI, at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7861812

The packages are for versions 2.0 and 2.1. All releases are still available on the PDAF website or as branches in the repository at Github. The registration on the PDAF website is now only necessary to access the older release packages or to subscribe to the maillist.

Further, we are happy to announce that there is now also a coupling of PDAF to the ocean model NEMO available. It has its own repository and is not included in the PDAF release package:
https://github.com/PDAF/NEMO-PDAF/

This code supports NEMO 4.0. Support for NEMO 4.2 is planned for the future.
The documentation can be found in the Wiki on github.com.

Finally, we will switch from the current hand-made mail list to a proper listmail server. Thus, future announcements from PDAF you will receive via the list pdaf@listserv.dfn.de. To contact us please use pdaf@awi.de as before or perhaps the 'Discussions' function on Github.

For the PDAF developers,

Lars Nerger
