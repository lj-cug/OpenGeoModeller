The following are some of what I am aware of.# romsviewPyQt5 Desktop GUI for visualization of ROMS input/output netcdf filesProject is in very early development, to get the UI started# GRIDMAPPython toolbox for ROMS grid files based on explicit map projections.Many approaches, such as `Seagrid` (Matlab), `Gridpak` (Fortran),`Gridgen` (python) are using advanced numerics to generate orhogonalgrids based on prescribed boundaries. This gives great flexibility foradapting the grid to the coastal geometry. The downside is that thereis no obvious mapping between longitude/latitude and the gridcoordinates.Gridmap has a different approach. The grid is based on well documentedorhogonal map projections. The generated grid is thereforeautomatically orhogonal (in most cases even orthonormal) and there isan explicit transformation between lon/lat and grid coordinates.  Itis presently independent of solvers in Fortran or C making it easy toinstall. At some point it may develop to depend on the `pyproj`package to benefit from the large range of projections provided.Presently it focuses on the polar stereographic projection, a goodchoice at relative high latitudes.Bj?rn ?dlandsvik  <bjorn at imr.no>Institute of Marine Research2014-10-08# pyromsguiGUI to view ROMS input/output files.
