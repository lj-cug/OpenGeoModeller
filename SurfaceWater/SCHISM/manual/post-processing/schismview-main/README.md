# schismview
A python based gui visualization tool for netcdf outputs of the SCHISM hydrodynamic model (SCHISM: http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/). The program is compatible with the combined schout_*.nc style format and the multiple variable output written with parallel io (ou2d_*.nc, zCoordinates_*.nc, ...).
