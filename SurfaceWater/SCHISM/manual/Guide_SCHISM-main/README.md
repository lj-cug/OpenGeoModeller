# Guide_SCHISM (August 2021)
This guide could be an appendix to the SCHISM manual available at: http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/SCHISM_v5.8-Manual.pdf. 
It was written to help beginners better deal with SCHISM v5.8 and the different steps to run simulations. 
It aims to try to gather as much information and links as possible on how to produce the input files in one place for 2D barotropic model and only for hindcast data studies. 
Of course this will evolve with the development of SCHISM and the tools that surround it, but it can be a good start to dive into the SCHISM world.
In this document the term "the manual" refers to the SCHISM Manual v5.8. 
This guide is primarily aimed at implementing SCHISM on a Linux platform, although, as you will see, our chosen grid generator is Windows-based.
