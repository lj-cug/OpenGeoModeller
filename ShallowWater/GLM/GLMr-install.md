Most of the build complexity seems to in figuring out version compatibility between AED and GLM. I feel it's pretty straightforward as these things go. Perhaps providing a build script would be doable.This seems to come down to cross-compiling issues between 20X and other Linux versions. We did test GLM3r primarily on Ubuntu 18.04 and Fedora (although for Fedora we also did deinstall the shared objects).Alternatively to removing exec/nixglm, we could delete the Sys.setenv in run_GLMnix:run_glmNIX <- function(sim_folder, verbose, system.args){  glm_path <- system.file('exec/nixglm', package=packageName())    Sys.setenv(LD_LIBRARY_PATH=paste(system.file('extbin/nixGLM',                                          package=packageName()),                                    Sys.getenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH'),                                    sep = ":"))  glm.systemcall(sim_folder, glm_path, verbose, system.args)}Ooh, that sounds good. I hadn't realized that LD_LIBRARY_PATH was being overridden. At least don't run that line when GLM_PATH is set.```
