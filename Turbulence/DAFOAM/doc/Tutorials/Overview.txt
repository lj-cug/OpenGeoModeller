DAFoam supports high-fidelity design optimization for a wide range of disciplines, e.g., aerodynamics, heat transfer, solid mechanics, and hydrodynamics.

The optimization configurations for the DAFoam tutorials are available from here. If you use the DAFoam Docker image, first start a Docker container, refer to this page. Then, for most of the tutorials, run this command for pre-processing:

./preProcessing.sh

Then, use this command to run the tutorial:

mpirun -np 4 python runScript.py 2>&1 | tee logOpt.txt

Check the instructions in each tutorial for details.
