##  Decomposition of mesh and initial field data
decomposeParDict
运行：decomposePar    # 区域分解


## Running a decomposed case
mpirun --hostfile <machines> -np <nProcs>
        <foamExec> <otherArgs> -parallel > log &
where: <nProcs> is the number of processors; <foamExec> is the executable, e.g.icoFoam; and, the output is redirected to a file named log. 

mpirun --hostfile machines -np 4 icoFoam -parallel > log &
